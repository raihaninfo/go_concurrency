Channels are a safe way of transferring data between goroutines without using a mutex. You can send data to a channel in one goroutine, then consume data from the same channel in another goroutine. By default, a channel does not have space to store data, so you must simultaneously send and receive data from the channel to avoid a deadlock. A buffered channel allows you to allocate space to temporarily store data in the channel.
